- Zero: Add dependencies: vuejs
- Zero: Worker.obey returns object
- Zero: Move Broker to root

- Mock 0FB to continue dev after the cancellation of the service?
Zero:
- JS: Minitasks, looping queues(?) promise interval?
- Zero/Vue maybe uses @egoist/poi
- VueJS, learn/use: this.$nextTick
- Maybe use: Singleton and/or Module pattern
- Maybe pass $doc to constructor

- Interesting protocols to rip off: MQTT http://mqtt.org/
- find a restful api for a typical chat app
- find IM app's different uml diagrams (not only classes)
- use `he` to decode html

ZeroBroker
==========
- Add ZeroBroker.request(fbid) and Messenger.sendFile(file)
- ZeroBroker deletes *parts* once it receives them.
- ZeroMessenger deletes *parts* once it reads them.
- ZeroProfile return {photoId} or {photoLink} so we can `ZeroBroker.request(photoId)`
- Files should not be auto-requested. Only request them if the user clicks on them.
- Instead of using my DSL maybe use JSON-RPC?

- Use Low Quality Image Placeholders, something like https://github.com/zouhir/lqip
hasManyParts() this.parts.length >= 3
if hasManyParts() create LQIP's thumbnail, else send colors' palate
Send part=0, data=base64(thumbnail) whose size is <= 10K characters.
10K characters in base64 = ? in binary

ZeroMessenger
=============
- ZeroWorker.getProfileInfo() should just return `myActivityLink` and not extract `myId` from it. Let ZeroMessenger do that. 
- Keep usernames in the form /user and not @user.
- Handle events ("Kaito left the group")
- Separate background and app
- Verify the existence of ZeroBroker
- Add option: No ZeroBroker but want to send ZeroMedia? "Do this if the recipient uses ZeroMessenger."
- message.isMine()? Hide senderName from the message bubble!
- Chat.canReply = Chat.isGroup ? hasComposer : (senderLink || nameAppearsInComposer)
- Message.status: fetched, sent, sending, failed
- Message .isMine(), sent(), resend()
- Add Right-To-Left support to Composer/Message.
- Add these attrs: Conversation._oldChunks, Conversation._isUpdating, _isLoading

threads.lastChecked, loading, isEmpty
thread.index = pageNum * 10 + index in page

TODO (Later)
============
- Rename `Moi` -> `ActiveUser`?
- Write ZeroCommon.js: stuff used by Messenger, Worker, and Broker.
- Serialize `composer` form and use axios to send messages. Use the FormData class instead of working with 'HTML <form> elements'.
- **Security**: Have I exposed myself to XSS attacks? (In the 'specialText' thing + converting it to HTML)
- Handle empty messages (that actually contain "0")? Maybe just assume "0" won't be sent or received.

Before I say anything, lemme ask you: Can you do it, @Wanis? Can you do it? Can you? Of course you can!
Will you do it, @Wanis? Will you do it? Will you? Of course not! You rich bastard >:(

Okay, listen up, Kaito has an awesomely pathetic/poor idea for this vacation:

Project Zero: "For Better"... or "0FB" for short >.<

It's basically a ("Cloud") bot that accesses my Facebook account and monitors my
incoming messages and downloads received pictures, and then, for each downloaded picture:

1) encodes it in BASE64 (kichghl "binary to text", Wikipedia it! ._.)
2) then splits the output to parts of length X
   (X is the maximum length of texts that Facebook allows)
3) and adds to some metadata (sender's id, date, part's number, etc)

4) Finally it sends those parts to my inbox... Something like this:

[[dreamski21 :: DATE :: 1-5 :: DATA]]
...
[[dreamski21 :: DATE :: 5-5 :: DATA]]

5) On the other end, another program (a Chrome extension probably)
  reads the parts,
  combines them,
  then displays the image with the included information (metadata)...
(Notice anything? Kinda similar to the TCP protocol~~~ wikipedia it >.<)

Aaaaand that's how Zero Facebook becomes a better shit ;-;

Oh, oh, also, I remember once you told me that you wanted to make an assistant-like app.
Well, why not do this and make it act like one?

"Zero, turn off the monitor"
"Zero, send me the profile picture of [id]"
"Zero, send the image in this post [url]"
"Zero, stalk [id]"

...Wait! Why just pics? Why not audio and video?

Oh fuck, let's think out of the box, boy: Why not make it act like a proxy?
A free/halal way to browse the Web using nothing but the shit Djezzy gives us!
Yup... You've guessed it: Kaito has no internet access anymore :/

*leaves the bus*

Kiddingo. Ain't no doing that because ain't no "lifeless nerd" >.<
